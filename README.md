It focuses on:

:arrow_right: lightness-native, displays only the device screen

:arrow_right: performance-30~60fps

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Make sure you enabled adb debugging on your device(s).

On some devices, you also need to enable an additional option to control it using keyboard and mouse.
